<h1>Active Directory (IAM) Home Lab Creation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a walkthrough of how I created an Active Directory home lab Environment using VirtualBox. Here are the tasks I've completed for this lab:<br />
<br />
- Installed a 2019 Microsoft Server to run Active Directory on it.<br /> 
- Configured a Domain Controller, then created a domain. <br />
- Installed and configured DHCP. <br />
- Ran a Powershell script to create over 1000 users in Active Directory. <br />
- Created a Client VM using a Windows 10 ISO, added it to the domain and proceeded to log into it with some of the newly created accounts. 
<br />
